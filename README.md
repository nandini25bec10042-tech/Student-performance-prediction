# Student-performance-prediction
# Overview
This project predicts students final exam marks using there attendance, study hours, past exam marks. The goal is to help students understand and provide teachers with a simple way to predict student outcome early. A Linear Regression model is used and a dataset of 30 students was created manually. 
# Features
•Predicts final exam marks. 
•uses attendance, study hours and past exam marks. 
•Simple and explainable M.L model
•Visulation:Actual marks vs Predicted marks
•Easy to run in Google Colab. 
# Technology/Tools used
•Python
•Pandas
•Google Colab
•Github
•NumPy
•Scikit-learn
•Matplotlib
# Steps to Install and Run the Project
# 1.Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/nandini25bec10042-tech/Student-performance-prediction.git
# 2.Open Notebook
•Go to notebooks folder. 
•Open student_performance.ipynb in Google Colab. 
# 3.Upload dataset
•Run the first cell. 
•upload student_performance.csv
# 4.Run all Cells
This will:
•Load the dataset
•Train M.L model
•Test accuracy
•Generate scatter plot
# Instructions for Testing
To test the model with custom values:
model.predict([[attendance, study_hours, past_marks]])
Example:
model.predict([[85, 3, 78]])
