# Project Statement

## 1. Problem Statement
Many students face difficulty in understanding how their study habits, attendance, and previous academic performance influence their final exam results. Educators also require simple tools to estimate student outcomes early so that necessary interventions can be made. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning–based system that can predict a student’s final marks using key academic indicators.

## 2. Scope of the Project
The project involves:
- Creating a dataset of student information.
- Preprocessing the data for machine learning.
- Building a Linear Regression model to predict final marks.
- Evaluating model accuracy.
- Generating visualizations for comparison of actual vs predicted marks.
- Documenting and presenting the solution using notebooks, screenshots, and GitHub.

## 3. Target Users
This project is designed for:
- Teachers and academic mentors who want to quickly estimate performance.
- Students who want insight into how study habits affect grades.
- Institutions analyzing academic trends.
- Beginners learning machine learning and data analysis.

## 4. High-Level Features
- **Custom Dataset Creation**: Attendance, study hours, past marks, and final marks.
- **Data Analysis & Cleaning**: Checking structure, types, and missing values.
- **Prediction Model**: Linear Regression for estimating final scores.
- **Performance Metrics**: R² score, Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error.
- **Visualization**: Scatter plot comparing actual and predicted marks.
- **Google Colab Notebook**: Step-by-step implementation.
- **GitHub Repository**: Contains code, dataset, screenshots, and documentation.
